<h1>Getting started with HTML</h1>

<b>How the World Wide Web Works</b>
<p>To see a web page, our computer sends an HTTP request to a server.
That server returns an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML document</a> to our computer. 
That document is a web page, which our web browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox, etc.) 
displays for us. 
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language.</b> 
Most web pages are HTML documents. They can contain a wide range of 
content formats, from plain text to images, forms, links... 
Web pages are generally made up of <b>text content</b> and
  and <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a></b> which dictates the format.

</p>

<b>Tags</b>
<p>Tags tell the document how to format or how to treat the text we want displayed. 
The tags are always surrounded by the symbols "<" and ">", which mean "open instruction" and "close instruction". 
In most tags, the close ">" is very important, to avoid the formatting affecting the entire document.
</p>

<b>Elements</b>
<p>An element is a tag plus its content. 

</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p><b>Block elements</b> form an "invisible box" around content. 
<b>Inline elements</b> just change the appearance or action of a part of the content.
  them.
